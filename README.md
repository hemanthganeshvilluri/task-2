📝 Objective
This project focuses on exploring and understanding a dataset using both statistical summaries and visualizations. The goal is to derive insights from data by identifying patterns, trends, anomalies, and feature-level characteristics.

🔧 Tools Used
Pandas – for data manipulation and summary statistics

Seaborn – for static statistical visualizations

Matplotlib – for plotting support and customization

Plotly – for interactive, web-ready visualizations

📌 Steps Performed
1. Summary Statistics
Calculated descriptive statistics such as mean, median, standard deviation, min/max, and quartiles.

Helped to understand the spread, central tendency, and variability of each numeric feature.

2. Distribution Visualization
Created histograms to observe the distribution and shape of each numeric feature.

Used boxplots to identify outliers and compare ranges across categories.

3. Relationship Analysis
Used pair plots to visualize pairwise relationships between numerical features across different categories.

Created a correlation matrix with heatmaps to identify features that are highly correlated (positively or negatively).

4. Anomaly, Trend, and Pattern Detection
Identified anomalies (outliers) via boxplots and statistical thresholds.

Detected trends over time or across groups using line plots and rolling averages.

Uncovered patterns such as clustering, feature separability, or relationships between variables using scatter plots and group-based visualizations.

5. Feature-Level Inferences
Analyzed each feature to determine:

Its distribution and variance

Presence of outliers

Redundancy or correlation with other features

Its usefulness for classification or regression tasks

Used visual tools like heatmaps, boxplots, and grouped comparisons to support observations.

6. Interactive Visualizations with Plotly
Created interactive charts such as:

Scatter plots

Histograms

Line plots

3D visualizations

Enabled zoom, hover, and filtering features to explore data more intuitively and present results effectively.
